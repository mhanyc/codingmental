_“Accessibility is like a blueberry muffin—you can’t push the berries in there afterward.”_

This summer, we migrated two of our Dental School projects, [MATCH](https://match.ccnmtl.columbia.edu) and [PASS](https://pass.ccnmtl.columbia.edu), from the CTL's content management tool Pagetree—a Django-based platform—to the Hugo framework. This move was done to provide a sustainable structure for the projects, and to make them open and linkable from multiple training environments to attract a broader audience.

With openness and sustainability come interesting challenges such as responsiveness and improving the sites' accessibility. We have committed ourselves to good faith effort in striving for comparable compliance to [Section 508 Accessibility Program](https://www.section508.gov/), and in making sure that both sites perform well on all devices including assistive technologies. 

Both MATCH and PASS have the same code base, architecture, and user interface. This it what Pagetree-MATCH (and Pagetree-PASS) looks like:

{{< figure src="/img/assets/match-screenshot.jpg" class="text-center" alt="A screenshot of Pagetree-MATCH web page." >}}

The UI is relatively straightforward. Each content page has a standard banner and footer, a chapter navigation (`sidenav`) on the left, and a main content body that occupies the bulk of the page. Below is a simplified wireframe to encapsulate the layout.

{{< figure src="/img/assets/match-layout.jpg" class="text-center" alt="A simplified wireframe to encapsulate the page layout." >}}

Pagetree-MATCH and its source code are neither responsive nor accessibility-compliant. Screen readers, such as [VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/), follows the elements on a page linearly in the order that they appear in the corresponding source code. The elements Pagetree-MATCH are coded in the source as follows:

```
<project logo 1>
<logo 2>
<module title>
<sidenav>
<page title>
<main content>
<previous page>
<next page>
<footerinfo>
<partner logo 1>
<partner logo 2>
```

The `sidenav` appears before the `main content` because it is a simple `div` that floats to the left. The source code yields the UI above and the form matches the its visual function. User can browse around the site with little obstruction.

However, VoiceOver reads the site in a linear flow as indicated by the red path:

{{< figure src="/img/assets/match-flow-rigid.gif" class="text-center" alt="This diagram is an illustration of the content flow as read by a screen reader." >}}

This flow is not an efficient outcome for a screen reader. The user will have to listen through the banner elements (`project logo 1`, `logo 2`, `module title`) and every item on the `sidenav` before reaching the main content.

So, we have to evaluate what the roles of each element are for the users, and we have to look at the page from the screen reader’s perspective. The most important portion on the page is content, which consists of the `page title` and `main content`. The `previous`-`next` navigation is also necessary for the users to connect sequentially to the chapters the site. The banner elements on the top of the page (logos, module title) is useful for branding and identification. The `sidenav` that contains the links to all the chapters in the module, while convenient for navigation, is auxiliary.

The elements of the page must be deconstructed and rearranged linearly as "heard" by the screen reader. The ideal flow path for the page should be a short trip through the banner elements, to the `page title` and `main content`. The complementary `sidenav` can appear later in the structure. To further help the users get to the main content quickly, a `skip to content` (or `skip`) link is placed at the top of the page. It is interesting to note that this arrangement accommodates the layout design for smartphones as well.

The new page structure in the source code for Hugo-MATCH is now the following:

```
<skip to content>
<project logo 1>
<logo 2>
<module title>
<page title>
<main content>
<previous page>
<next page>
<sidenav>
<footerinfo>
<partner logo 1>
<partner logo 2>
```

Here is the corresponding linear wireframe:

{{< figure src="/img/assets/match-flow-simple-a11y.gif" class="text-center" alt="This diagram is an illustration of the optimized content flow as read by a screen reader." >}}

A screen reader will read the page along the red path. If the user triggers the `skip` navigation, the screen reader will follow the green path.

The reordering of the page elements is not the only approach that needed to be done for accessibility. Proper headings, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks and roles are used extensively to identify these elements semantically (for instance, navigation, main content, complementary content, and footer).

And finally, these elements, with the new structure intact, are placed back in the original UI design using new CSS definitions and Bootstrap framework for responsiveness. This is the wireframe of the interface with the aforementioned screen reader paths.

{{< figure src="/img/assets/match-flow-a11y.gif" class="text-center" alt="A simplified wireframe to encapsulate the page layout and the new arragement of elements." >}}

While the Hugo- and Pagetree-MATCH wireframes "look" the same, the source codes are quite different as the result of the overhaul to make the pages responsive and more accessible.
