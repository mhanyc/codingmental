On Friday April 21 I attended the first annual Rebellious Psychiatry symposium at Yale. Inspired by the #RebelliousLaw series, this event was billed as "Where Mental Health Meets Social Justice".

I was impressed at some of the work happening in New Haven. Every conference slot had a "stakeholders" track, and peers appeared on multiple panels throughout the day. It was too bad they did not manage to recruit farther across campus, as there were no social scientists, humanists, social theorists or even psychologists in the mix. Still, it was a great program, especially the keynote by Mindy Fulliove, a psychiatrist who treats cities (the conf wasn't taped, but there are lots of her talks [up on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mindy+thompson+fullilove)).  

"[Structural Competencies](https://structuralcompetency.org/)" is also a powerful construct and a budding community.

I managed to convince the organizers that next year they absolutely need to have a digital/media track ;-) 

PS  - you can meet some of the folks who participated in this conference at this screening next Friday, May 12th - https://crazywisefilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NYC-Flyer-v1.pdf
