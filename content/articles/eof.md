This is my final post on this blog as a Columbia employee. Taking a cue from
our not-so-lame-duck prez (see:
[#obamajama](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2533698)),
I’ll indulge in the conceit of reflecting on my legacy at
Columbia with a wink to my successor.

I started working at the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning
(CCNMTL) in May 2004. While I’ve probably shared the story of how I landed at
Columbia hundreds of times, I’ve never captured it fully in writing. I’ve
written extensively about the circumstances of my departure from my previous
employer for a course on the Political Economy of Media at the New School back
in 2007
[_Fabricating Freedom: Free Software Developers at Work and Play_](http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/38498),
but that essay focused more on an analysis of free software and labor, and
neglected to explore the connections between open source communities and
education.

As I wrote in _Fabricating Freedom_, at the beginning of the millennium I found
myself backpacking across Eastern Europe as a software developer, participating
in coding hackathons held in Viennese castles and Norwegian fjords.
Intermingling with artists and social theorists was an essential component of
these gatherings. I wasn’t particularly politically conscious as an undergrad,
and my experiences within a vibrant open source community awakened my interest
in what some might call politics — governance, decision making and conflict
resolution. I also came to understand the Plone community as a self-organized
knowledge community, one that continually promotes active learning among all
participants.  I would not read Seymour Papert’s
[_Mindstorms_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms_%28book%29)
until years later, but looking back it is easy to recognize how this open source community
began to fulfill Papert’s vision of schools without walls or classrooms. I also
experienced the lessons of Jacques Rancière’s
[_The Ignorant Schoolmaster_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ranci%C3%A8re#Life_and_work Ignorant Schoolmaster)
first-hand as the Python community collectively embarked on intellectual emancipation.

I decided to plot a course to the academy, unsure how I would make the
transition. I applied to the Instructional Technology masters program at
Teachers College and while my application was under review I was hired as a
developer at CCNMTL; and the rest is history. The job came with free tuition,
and my original plans flipped as I began working full-time at CCNMTL and
studying part-time. CCNMTL’s executive director,
[Frank Moretti](http://alchemicalmusings.org/2013/07/16/dear-frank/),
was also on the faculty of Teachers College and the Columbia Graduate School
of Journalism’s doctoral program in communication. He soon became  my mentor,
boss, teacher and friend.

People often wondered how I held down a full-time job while working on a Ph.D.
I responded that students of the natural sciences often book 40+ hours per week
in a lab, and working for Frank was about as close as I could imagine to a
communications laboratory as there existed. My coursework and publications were
often inspired and drawn directly from our work at CCNMTL:

I soon learned that I tolerated meetings and office politics better than my
fellow developers, and was dragged, kicking and screaming, into management
<img src="/img/assets/emoji-wink.png" style="height: 20px;"/>.
Most of the time I really enjoyed liaising with other groups within our Center
and across the university. I especially enjoyed making a systematic case for
free culture and critical pedagogy. The bulk of the software our team developed
is published on [Github](https://github.com/ccnmtl/) openly under GPL licenses.
We didn’t have as much success (yet) in openly licensing educational content,
or convincing central IT to commit to open source solutions. Some of our
projects are now part of the commons and I’ve helped educate and persuade
numerous faculty on the value of transparency, collaborative production and
open licensing.

My biggest disappointment around Intellectual Property at Columbia concerns our
administration’s failure to follow through its stated mission to the public.
It always seemed like Columbia was perfectly positioned to take the lead on
meaningful, progressive copyright reform, but we often got the opposite. Our
former university librarian, Jim Neal, is a strong proponent for copyright
reform, and would regularly host conferences such as
[Correcting Course](http://correctingcourse.columbia.edu/program.html).
Under Jim, CCNMTL worked on various projects which involved strong assertion
of Fair Use. The Center demonstrated clearly in practice what might become
impossible if copyright law becomes even more draconian. President Bollinger
is a First Amendment scholar who also took the University of Michigan to the
Supreme Court fighting for affirmative action. Unfortunately, Bollinger
neglects to connect his free speech advocacy to the copyright wars, and
Columbia continues to lag behind our peers on advocacy and policy, instead of
leading the charge.

I tried to take my job title of “Technical Architect” pretty seriously, and
enrolled in a few architecture courses at Columbia
[GSAPP](https://www.arch.columbia.edu). I wrote about ways that software
architecture has begun to resemble increasingly traditional architecture as a
leading art, and characterized Yochai Benkler as an architectural theorist
([_Possibility Spaces_](http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/69866):
_Architecture and the Builders of Information Societies_). I directly applied
the ideas as described on CTL’s
[Project Development page](http://ctl.columbia.edu/support/project-development/)
to educational environments, which then lead to the question: what sorts of
values do we intend to infuse in our applications? If software is our  medium,
and the medium is the message, what sorts of messages do our applications communicate?

My team’s job begins where commodity software solutions leave off, leaving us
to grapple with problems at the cutting edge of teaching, learning, research
and publishing. We regularly innovate ways to improve networked critical
analysis with a portfolio of projects that help students collaborate around the
production and critical analysis of new media. Student-centric workflows and
dashboards that enable faculty to easily assess student work are often missing
from consumer tools. We worked hard to preserve the core scholarly values like
citation and reference, and encouraged students to show their work and reflect
on their process. Some of my favorite projects helped faculty translate their
research software from the lab bench to the classroom, introducing the ability
for students to save, address and compare different runs of their work.  We
challenged students to question algorithmic black boxes and pushed them to
explain their work in ways that were replicable. Throughout these design
iterations we attempted to satisfy Frank’s incessant demand to answer the
(seemingly) simple question — “So what?”

Our best projects in my tenure have emerged from deep relationships with
faculty, and have connected their research to their classroom and to the world.
At our best, our educational interventions were exploratory salvos, with the
lessons learned shared in posts, presentations, papers and code. We operated
like a think tank that’s always experimenting  and learning. Part of what made
this work was our original mandate, stipulating that if we never failed, it
meant we weren’t taking enough risks. Many of the patterns we developed were
reused, either by being backed into libraries, or through iteration and
refinement. The developers at CTL practice
[Design Research](http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/dr/) across projects, perpetually
applying the knowledge gained from one project to the next.

Lorena Barba recently delivered the Keynote at PyCon ‘16 where she argued that
teaching people to collaborate effectively is more important, and harder, than
teaching them to code. She thinks that the style of collaboration found in most
open source projects is a model for educators to build upon:

The dream of collaboration remains an intriguing and often elusive promise of
networked technologies. For my swan song at Columbia, Mark Phillipson and I
co-presented on digital collaboration at the graduate student orientation:

We recounted many ways that we’ve collaborated over the years, around documents
authoring, wikis, and project management tools. The talk made me realize how
far we’ve come, as many of the tools that were esoteric and rare a decade ago
are now commonplace. Yet, we are still mostly stuck with course-centric
learning management platforms instead of student-centric ones, and
collaborative, distributed research remains a stumbling block in most
disciplines. Many of the challenges are socio-cultural, as egos and competition
continue to drive the academy. If we remember to focus on teaching students and
not subjects, the pedagogies we promote need to prioritize values over
competencies. And, the software we develop needs to embody those values.
