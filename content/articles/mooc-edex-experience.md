My work with Massive Open Online Courses
([MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course))​
began two years ago when I joined​ ​the Center for Teaching and Learning​ at
Columbia University​. I ​didn’t have previous experience working on MOOCs but I
was excited to take on this new endeavor. The course​ that I worked on​ was a
three-part series based on the
[Civil War and Reconstruction​](https://www.edx.org/course?search_query=foner)
taught by DeWitt Clinton Professor of History
[Eric Foner](http://www.ericfoner.com).
My role on this project was to edit the course videos and assist with ​its
design. The course​ enrollment​ reached twelve thousand worldwide​. Many of
​the enrollees were history buffs as well as those who were learning about the
Civil War and Reconstruction for the first time.

Along the way I learned many valuable lessons. I kept a journal of my thoughts,
ideas, successes and failures on a small notebook. Looking back,​ I'm amazed
at the amount of work that was covered. I learned how to design an effective
course using the edX platform. I had the opportunity to see the course develop
into a MOOC from the perspective of a video editor and a course designer.

I gathered these thoughts and lessons from my notebook and I created a
[Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mt-xETJ29INuOmdV1U_5y1Tcci86mSTofiaiDti0xQU/edit)
to share with others who are interested in creating MOOCs. I
frequently update the document with new ideas, thoughts​,​ and tips. ​I’ve​
learned so much about MOOCs in the past two years and I’ve had the honor to
work with many talented people from CTL who have taught me a great deal
throughout this journey. I would love
[to hear some of your thoughts](http://ctl.columbia.edu/about/team/diaz/),
ideas and tips on how to build an effective MOOC course.
